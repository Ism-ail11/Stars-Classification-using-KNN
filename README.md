# Stars-Classification-using-KNN
Project Description:
The project focuses on developing a classification system for stars using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The goal is to accurately classify stars based on their observable features, allowing astronomers and researchers to gain insights into stellar populations and properties.

The project will involve the following key components and functionalities:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of stars with known classifications and their corresponding observable features. These features may include spectral characteristics, luminosity, temperature, distance, and other relevant attributes.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected star data by handling missing values, normalizing numeric attributes, and encoding categorical variables if necessary. This step ensures the data is in a suitable format for k-NN classification.

Feature Selection: Identify the most informative and relevant features from the dataset. Consider domain knowledge and statistical techniques (e.g., correlation analysis) to select features that have a significant impact on star classification.

Training and Testing Sets: Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing subsets. The training set will be used to build the k-NN model, while the testing set will evaluate its performance.

k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm: Implement the k-NN algorithm, which classifies stars by finding the k closest neighbors in the feature space. The class label assigned to a star is determined by the majority class of its nearest neighbors.

Model Training: Train the k-NN model using the training set. Adjust the hyperparameters such as the value of k, distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance), and any other relevant parameters to optimize the model's performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained k-NN model using the testing set. Calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's classification performance.

Predictions: Utilize the trained k-NN model to make predictions on unseen or future star data. The model will classify new stars based on their observable features, providing insights into their likely stellar classification.

Performance Optimization: Fine-tune the k-NN model by experimenting with different values of k, distance metrics, and feature combinations to improve classification accuracy and efficiency.

Throughout the project, utilize programming languages such as Python and relevant libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) for data preprocessing, implementing the k-NN algorithm, and performance evaluation.

By successfully implementing this project, you will develop a classification system for stars using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. This system will aid astronomers and researchers in categorizing stars based on their observable features, enabling a better understanding of stellar populations and their characteristics.
